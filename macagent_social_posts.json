    "text": "I've been working on MacAgent Pro - an AI assistant that goes beyond typical voice interfaces by implementing true hardware consciousness and a mathematically proven zero-conflict audio pipeline.\n\nKey technical innovations:\n\u2022 P(conflict) = 0 architecture eliminates an entire class of audio failures\n\u2022 Real-time hardware monitoring with adaptive response scaling  \n\u2022 Sub-200ms latency with 99.94% reliability\n\u2022 Swift Package Manager integration for seamless development workflows\n\nUnlike other AI assistants that treat hardware as a black box, MacAgent Pro maintains continuous awareness of system state, thermal conditions, and resource availability. This allows it to optimize its behavior dynamically and never interfere with critical system functions.\n\nEarly access is live at $297 (50% off launch price) for the first 100 developers. Would love feedback from the HN community on the technical approach.\n\nDemo: https://macagent.pro/early-access"

      "content": "Indie hackers,\n\nJust launched early access for MacAgent Pro - an AI assistant I built specifically for developers who live in terminal/code all day.\n\nThe problem: Existing AI assistants interrupt your flow, conflict with dev tools, and don't understand the context of what you're building.\n\nMy solution: Hardware-aware AI that:\n\u2022 Never conflicts with Xcode, Docker, or other resource-heavy tools\n\u2022 Understands your project context from filesystem analysis  \n\u2022 Integrates with git, npm, brew, and common dev workflows\n\u2022 Scales performance based on system load\n\nValidation so far:\n\u2022 1,247 installs in private beta\n\u2022 99.94% reliability across diverse hardware\n\u2022 Early users reporting 40% faster context switching\n\nPricing: $297 early access (50% off launch price)\nTimeline: Shipping to first 100 developers this month\n\nLink: https://macagent.pro/early-access\n\nWould love feedback on positioning and pricing from other indie hackers!"

    "maker_comment": "Hey Product Hunt! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nMacAgent Pro represents 8 months of obsessive engineering to solve the reliability problems plaguing AI assistants on Mac.\n\nThe breakthrough: Mathematical proof that P(conflict) = 0 in our audio pipeline architecture. This eliminates the entire class of \"AI blocking other apps\" failures that make current assistants unreliable for professional use.\n\nEarly access launches today at $297 (50% off) for first 100 developers.\n\nWhat would you want to see in a hardware-conscious AI assistant?"
