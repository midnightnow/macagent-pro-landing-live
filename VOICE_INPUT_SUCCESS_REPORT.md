## 🎯 Key Technical Features

### Voice Activation Flow:
```
1. User says "Hey MacAgent check temperature"
2. Speech recognizer detects wake word
3. Command extracted: "check temperature"
4. Routed to thermal handler  
5. MacAgentHardwareMonitor gets real thermal data
6. AI speaks response: "Your CPU is 65°C, that's a bit warm but okay"
```

### Supported Commands:
- **"Hey MacAgent, check my temperature"** → Real CPU/GPU temperature data
- **"MacAgent, optimize my Mac"** → System performance optimization
- **"Hey Mac, how much memory am I using?"** → Real RAM usage statistics
- **"MacAgent, help me free up storage"** → Disk usage analysis
- **"MacAgent, help"** → Voice command guidance

### Permission Management:
- **Automatic detection** of permission status
- **User-friendly dialogs** with system preferences links
- **Graceful degradation** when permissions not granted
- **Real-time status updates** in menu bar interface
