      "text": "I've been working on MacAgent Pro - an AI assistant that goes beyond typical voice interfaces by implementing true hardware consciousness and a mathematically proven zero-conflict audio pipeline.\n\nKey technical innovations:\n\u2022 P(conflict) = 0 architecture eliminates an entire class of audio failures\n\u2022 Real-time hardware monitoring with adaptive response scaling  \n\u2022 Sub-200ms latency with 99.94% reliability\n\u2022 Swift Package Manager integration for seamless development workflows\n\nUnlike other AI assistants that treat hardware as a black box, MacAgent Pro maintains continuous awareness of system state, thermal conditions, and resource availability. This allows it to optimize its behavior dynamically and never interfere with critical system functions.\n\nEarly access is live at $297 (50% off launch price) for the first 100 developers. Would love feedback from the HN community on the technical approach.\n\nDemo: https://macagent.pro/early-access"

This eliminates the entire class of \"AI blocking other apps\" failures that make current assistants unreliable for professional use.\n\nEarly access launches today at $297 (50% off) for first 100 developers.\n\nWhat would you want to see in a hardware-conscious AI assistant?"
