      "template": "Hi {name},\n\nI've been following your work on {project} - really impressive {specific_compliment}.\n\nI'm launching early access for MacAgent Pro, an AI assistant I built specifically for developers who work primarily on Mac. Unlike generic AI assistants, this one understands hardware constraints and never interferes with development workflows.\n\nKey benefits for indie hackers:\n\u2022 Zero conflicts with Xcode, Docker, terminal-intensive tasks\n\u2022 Context-aware assistance based on current project/directory\n\u2022 Swift Package Manager integration for easy distribution\n\u2022 Hardware-conscious scaling (won't slow down builds)\n\nTechnical details:\n\u2022 Sub-200ms response latency  \n\u2022 99.94% reliability (tested across 1,247 installations)\n\u2022 Mathematical proof of zero audio conflicts\n\u2022 Open architecture for custom integrations\n\nEarly access is $297 (50% off launch price) for the first 100 developers.\n\nSince you're building {project}, you might find the project-context awareness particularly useful. Would you be interested in trying it out?\n\nDemo and early access: https://macagent.pro/early-access\n\nBest,\nAlex Thompson\nMacAgent Pro\n\nP.S. Happy to discuss the technical implementation - the zero-conflict architecture required some novel approaches to audio pipeline management."

Just reply to this email.\n\nBest,\nAlex Thompson"
