## 📱 Hacker News Launch Post

**Title:** Show HN: MacAgent – Hardware-aware AI built specifically for Mac

**Comment:**
```
I built MacAgent because generic AI assistants don't understand Macs at the 
hardware level. This reads your actual thermal sensors, monitors Apple Silicon 
core distribution, and provides fixes based on real hardware state - not just 
text pattern matching.

Example: Instead of "try restarting," it says "Your P-cores are thermal 
throttling at 98°C due to Spotlight indexing conflicting with your Docker 
containers. Here's the specific fix..."

Built for Apple Silicon from day one. The Ultra tier ($99/mo) includes 
predictive failure detection based on SSD wear patterns and thermal history.

Free web version helps with common issues. Native app reads hardware directly.

## 🚀 Reddit Launch Posts

### r/macapps
**Title:** "Free Mac troubleshooter that actually understands your hardware"

**Body:**
Built MacAgent because I was tired of generic "restart your Mac" advice. This AI actually reads your thermal sensors, memory pressure, and SSD health to provide specific fixes.

Free web version: Just type "my Mac is doing X" and get expert guidance.
Native app: Reads hardware directly for definitive answers.

Example: Instead of guessing why your fan is loud, it tells you exactly which process is causing thermal throttling and how to fix it.

Built specifically for Apple Silicon. Link: https://macagent.pro

### r/MacOS  
**Title:** "Built an AI that fixes Mac issues using actual hardware data"

**Body:**
Tired of forum posts that say "works fine for me"? MacAgent reads your Mac's actual sensors to provide specific solutions.

It knows your CPU temperature, memory pressure, SSD health, battery cycles, and thermal state. So instead of generic advice, you get targeted fixes.

Free web troubleshooter + paid native app with full hardware integration.

Works especially well on Apple Silicon Macs where it can read Neural Engine usage and core distribution.

## 🔥 Social Media Launch

### Twitter/X Thread
```
🧵 1/7 Spent 6 months building the first AI that actually understands Mac hardware

Generic AI: "Your Mac is slow, try restarting"
MacAgent: "P-cores throttling at 98°C, Spotlight + Docker conflict, here's the fix"

🍎 Built for Apple Silicon from day one
```

```  
2/7 The problem: Every Mac is different 

M1 vs Intel thermals are totally different
16GB unified memory ≠ 16GB DDR4  
T2 chip adds security complexity

Generic advice fails because it ignores YOUR Mac's hardware state
```

```
3/7 MacAgent reads actual sensors:
🌡️ CPU/GPU temperatures 
🔋 Battery cycles & health
💾 SSD wear patterns
🧠 Neural Engine usage
⚡ Memory pressure (real, not Activity Monitor)
🔧 SMC power states
```

```
4/7 Real example from yesterday:

User: "Mac running hot, fan loud"
MacAgent: "Thermal throttling detected. Chrome tab leak consuming 847MB, P-core temp 94°C. WindowServer high GPU due to external 4K display scaling. Solution: Close Chrome, reset display scaling to native res"
```

```
5/7 Three tiers:
💼 Pro ($10): Basic hardware monitoring + troubleshooting
🚀 Max ($30): Real-time optimization + automation  
🍎 Ultra ($99): Full Apple Silicon integration + predictive AI

Free web version available - no download required
```

```
6/7 Technical details:
- Direct SMC sensor access
- Apple Silicon P/E core monitoring  
- T2 chip integration
- SSD SMART data analysis
- Battery chemistry modeling
- Thermal envelope optimization
```

```  
7/7 Ready for Apple Intelligence integration when it drops

This is the Mac AI assistant Apple should have built
